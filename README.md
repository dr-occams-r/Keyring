# Keyring - TPU

## Design Features
- Strong and resistant key ring that is printable
- TPU material is flexible and strong
- Easy printing
- Comfortable in pockets

## Usage
- Put the pointed tip through the loop
- Pull through until tight
- Slowly walk the loop over the tapered barb section
- TPU will stretch as it is forced
- Bend the barb section to stretch it out and flatten it and walk the loop
- Use finger nail to push each side of loop forward
- Once the loop is past the barb and into the groove, the TPU will go back to it's initial shape and it will be difficult to open accidentally
- Cut off the pointed tip with a filament cutter or scissors
- The ring could in theory be reused, but probably not worth the trouble since it is cheap and fast to make new ones.  
- The ring can be cut off to remove the keys and redo the key set on a new key ring.

## Dependencies
Depends on the BOSL2 library, of which a cached local version is included.
